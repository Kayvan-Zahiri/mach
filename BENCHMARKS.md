# Performance Benchmarks

## Methodology

### Test Environment

- **Python**: 3.11
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090
- **CPU**: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K
- **OS**: Linux 6.11.0-29-generic

### What We Measure

**Kernel Performance Only**: All benchmarks measure only the core delay-and-sum beamforming kernel execution time. We explicitly **exclude**:
- CPU↔GPU memory transfers (depends on PCIe bandwidth, motherboard, etc., and pre-/post-processing steps may keep data on the GPU)
- JIT compilation (amortized over multiple function-calls)
- Data format reshaping (varies by scanner or file format)
- Pre-processing and post-processing steps (bit-unpacking, demodulation, clutter filtering, etc.; varies by ultrasound sequence)

The benchmark focuses on the most compute-/memory-bandwidth-intensive part of beamforming rather than system-specific overheads.

### Benchmark Dataset

We use PyMUST's [rotating-disk Doppler dataset](https://github.com/creatis-ULTIM/PyMUST/blob/170ba68/examples/rotatingDisk_real.ipynb) as our primary benchmark:

- **128 receive elements** (L7-4 linear array)
- **63,001 voxels** (25mm × 25mm grid, 0.1mm spacing)
- **32 frames** (temporal ensemble)

This represents a realistic ultrafast imaging workload, although it is a small microbenchmark compared to the 3D, high-channel count datasets we're actually interested in.

The benchmark scripts use the following settings:
* linear interpolation
* f-number: `1.0`

## Performance Results

| Implementation | Median Runtime | Points/Second | "Mach factor" |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **mach (GPU)** | **0.23 ms** | **1.13 × 10¹²** | **6.5×** |
| Speed-of-Sound (35mm) | 1.5 ms |  | 1× |
| vbeam (JAX/GPU) | 3.6 ms | 7.2 × 10¹⁰ | 0.42× |
| PyMUST (CPU) | 67 ms | 3.8 × 10⁹ | 0.022× |

### What does "beamforming at the speed of sound" even mean?

The **speed-of-sound** ("Mach 1"), represents the theoretical minimum time required for ultrasound waves to travel to the deepest imaging point and back, multiplied by the number of frames in the dataset.
This is specific to each imaging scenario. For our benchmark with PyMUST's [rotating-disk Doppler dataset](https://github.com/creatis-ULTIM/PyMUST/blob/170ba68/examples/rotatingDisk_real.ipynb):

- **Maximum imaging depth**: 35 mm
- **Speed of sound in rotating disk**: 1,480 m/s
- **Round-trip time**: 2 × 0.035 m ÷ 1,480 m/s = 47 μs per frame
- **Total for 32 frames**: 47.3 μs × 32 = **1.5 ms**

mach's processing time depends on various factors (see [Computational Complexity](#computational-complexity)),
so the "Mach factor" description is specific to this benchmark.

## Benchmark Reproduction

All benchmarks can be reproduced using the included test suite:

```bash
# Run full benchmark suite
make benchmark

# Generate performance plots
uv run --group compare tests/plot_benchmark.py --output assets/benchmark-doppler_disk.svg
uv run --group compare tests/plot_benchmark.py --points-per-second --output assets/benchmark-doppler_disk_pps.svg
```

The benchmark job in our CI pipeline ([`test_gpu.yml`](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_gpu.yml)) automatically runs these benchmarks (on a T4 GPU) across different commits and releases, providing continuous performance monitoring.

### Regression checking

`make benchmark-compare` runs the same benchmarks as `make benchmark` and fails when a median runtime is more than 25% slower than a saved pytest-benchmark JSON file:

```bash
# Compare against a JSON saved under .benchmarks/ by an earlier run
make benchmark-compare BENCHMARK_BASELINE=path/to/earlier-run.json

# Use a tighter threshold
make benchmark-compare BENCHMARK_BASELINE=path/to/earlier-run.json BENCHMARK_REGRESSION_THRESHOLD=median:10%
```

If the baseline file does not exist, the target records a run without comparing.
Only benchmarks that also appear in the baseline are checked.
In CI, the others are listed in a warning, and the job fails if no benchmark from the run is in the baseline.
pytest-benchmark warns that `machine_info` is different when any field of it differs from the baseline, host name included, and still runs the comparison.

In CI, the baseline is the benchmark JSON attached to the GitHub release named by `BENCHMARK_BASELINE_TAG` in [`test_gpu.yml`](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_gpu.yml), so every run compares against the same results until the tag is bumped.
Publishing a release runs the benchmark without the regression check and attaches the results to that release; to make them the new baseline, set `BENCHMARK_BASELINE_TAG` to that release's tag.
If the pinned release has no benchmark JSON, the benchmark job records its results without a regression check and shows a warning, also written to the job summary.
If `BENCHMARK_BASELINE_TAG` names no release, the release has more than one JSON asset, or the lookup fails for another reason, the `benchmark-baseline` job fails and the benchmark job does not run.

## CUDA Optimizations

mach optimizes GPU memory access patterns to improve performance. For those interested in learning more about CUDA optimization, excellent resources include:

- [CUDA Crash Course](https://github.com/CoffeeBeforeArch/cuda_programming/) by CoffeeBeforeArch
- [How CUDA Programming Works](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s41487/) - CUDA Architect presentation on CUDA best-practices
- [Optimizing Parallel Reduction in CUDA](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf) - NVIDIA example of optimizing a different algorithm

### Key Optimizations in mach

#### 1. **Coalesced Memory Access**
- Channel data organized as `[n_receive_elements, n_samples, n_frames]`
- Frames dimension is contiguous for [coalesced access](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-access-global-memory-efficiently-cuda-c-kernels/) to reduce global memory reads

#### 2. **Pre-computed Transmit Wavefront Arrivals**
- Pre-compute transmit arrival times to amortize delay calculation across repeated kernel calls
- However, cannot pre-compute the full transmit+receive delay matrix (like PyMUST) for large datasets: (would require transmits × voxels × channels x `size(float)` memory)

#### 3. **Shared Memory for Delay Tables**
- Transmit-to-receive delays computed only once per voxel (not 32× for 32 frames)
- Delay and apodization tables cached in shared memory
- Reused across all frames for each voxel

### Memory Bandwidth and Compute Utilization

The current thread-block and L1-cache parameters were selected for an [RTX4090 (Blackwell)](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf). These should work well across [Blackwell Architecture GPUs](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf).

If you're wondering if different thread-block or L1-cache parameters might be better for your specific GPU, [Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute) can be helpful to identify bottlenecks.

Anecdotally, kernel-duration seems to hit a pareto-optimum at >70% memory+compute-efficiency. Changing parameters at that point tends to trade-off memory/compute in a way that doesn't change the overall kernel-time.

## Scaling Performance

(computational-complexity)=
### Computational Complexity

The beamforming algorithm scales as:
```
O(n_voxels × n_elements × n_frames)
```

For the PyMUST dataset: `63,001 voxels × 128 elements × 32 frames ≈ 2.6 × 10⁸` points

### GPU Memory (VRAM) Usage

mach allocates GPU memory only for input arguments and the output result; no intermediate arrays are created during computation, simplifying memory management.

Total GPU memory usage scales as:
```
O(n_voxels × n_frames + n_elements × n_samples × n_frames)
```

Where:
- **First term** (`n_voxels × n_frames`): Output array size—dominates for large imaging grids
- **Second term** (`n_elements × n_samples × n_frames`): Input data size—dominates for high-channel-count systems

#### Memory Usage Example

Here is an example functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) workload:
- **Imaging grid**: 100×100×100 voxels (1M points)
- **Temporal frames**: 200 frames
- **Matrix probe**: 1024 elements
- **Samples per channel**: 100
- **Data type**: `complex64` (8 bytes per sample)

**Memory breakdown:**
```
channel_data:       (1024, 100, 200) → 164 MB
rx_coords_m:        (1024, 3)        → 12 KB
scan_coords_m:      (1M, 3)          → 12 MB
tx_wave_arrivals_s: (1M,)            → 4 MB
out:                (1M, 200)        → 1.6 GB
                                    ─────────
Total GPU memory:                    ~1.78 GB
```

In this example, the output array (`out`) represents 90% of memory usage, demonstrating how large imaging grids dominate memory requirements for volumetric datasets.

### Performance Scaling with Dataset Size

Typical functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) datasets we're targeting:
- **1024+ receive elements** (high-density arrays)
- **1M+ voxels** (volumetric or high-resolution imaging)
- **100+ frames** (longer temporal windows)

The performance scaling tests measure how mach's beamforming performance scales with different dataset dimensions:

- **Voxel scaling**: Testing grid resolution from 1e-4 (default) to 1e-5 meters (63k to 6.3M voxels)
- **Element scaling**: Testing 1x to 64x receive elements (128 to 8,192 elements)
- **Frame scaling**: Testing 1/32x to 16x ensemble size (1 to 512 frames)

To run the scaling benchmarks and then generate plots:

```bash
# Run pytest-benchmark
make benchmark

# Generate plots
python tests/plot_scaling.py --output assets/benchmark-scaling.svg
```

*Figure: throughput is largely consistent across dataset sizes, except for a small decrease for <16 frames.*

## Performance Suggestions

For Maximum Throughput:

1. **Keep data on GPU**: Use CuPy/JAX arrays to avoid CPU↔GPU transfers
2. **Use sufficient ensemble size**: Use ≥16 frames for complex64 or ≥32 frames for float32 to fully coalesce reads to global memory
3. **Ensure contiguous frame dimension**: The kernel requires frame-contiguous memory layouts.
