An ultrafast CUDA-accelerated ultrasound beamformer for Python users. Developed at [Forest Neurotech](https://forestneurotech.org/).

![Benchmark Results](assets/benchmark-doppler_disk.svg)

_[Benchmark](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md): Beamforming PyMUST's [rotating-disk Doppler dataset](https://github.com/creatis-ULTIM/PyMUST/blob/170ba68/examples/rotatingDisk_real.ipynb) at 1.1 trillion points per second ([**6.5**x the speed of sound](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md))._

## Highlights

* ⚡ **Ultra-fast beamforming**: ~10x faster than prior state-of-the-art
* 🚀 **GPU-accelerated**: Leverages CUDA for maximum performance on NVIDIA GPUs
* 🎯 **Optimized for research**: Designed for functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) and other ultrafast, high-channel-count, or volumetric-ensemble imaging
* 🐍 **Python bindings**: Zero-copy integration with CuPy, and JAX arrays via [nanobind](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). NumPy support included.
* 🔬 **Validated**: Matches [vbeam](https://github.com/magnusdk/vbeam) and [PyMUST](https://github.com/creatis-ULTIM/PyMUST) [outputs](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/tree/812062f/tests/compare)


## Installation

### Install from PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip install mach-beamform
```

Or: to include all optional dependencies, including to run the examples:
```bash
pip install mach-beamform[all]
```

Wheel prerequisites:
* [Linux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) with glibc >= 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL 9, Debian 12)
* CUDA-enabled GPU with driver >= 12.3, [compute-capability >= 7.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

### Build from source

```bash
make compile
```
Build prerequisites:
* Linux
* `make`
* `uv >= 0.9.7`
* `gcc >= 8`
* `nvcc >= 12.8`

### Docker Development

Compile and test without installing the CUDA *toolkit* using our Docker development environment.

**Prerequisites:**
* Docker Engine with [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
* CUDA-capable GPU with driver >= 12.3

**Quick start:**

```bash
# Build and start development container
docker compose run --rm dev

# Or use make shortcuts
make docker-build  # Build image (first time: ~2-3 min, rebuilds: ~30s)
make docker-dev    # Run container
```

**Inside the container:**

```bash
make compile  # Compile CUDA extension
make test     # Run tests
```

Your source code is mounted from the host, so you can edit files locally and compile in the container. Build artifacts (`.venv/` and `build/`) are stored in anonymous volumes to avoid permission issues. Dependencies are pre-installed in the image and cached, so rebuilds are fast when only source code changes.

## Examples

Try our [examples](https://forest-neurotech.github.io/mach/examples/):

* [📊 Plane Wave Imaging with PICMUS Dataset](examples/plane_wave_compound.py)
* [🩸 Doppler Imaging](examples/doppler.py)

If you don't have a CUDA-enabled GPU, you can download the notebook from the [docs](https://forest-neurotech.github.io/mach/examples/) and open in Google Colab (select a GPU instance).

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/blob/812062f/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Roadmap

### Beta release (v0.Y.0)
- ✅ Single-wave transmissions (plane wave, focused, diverging)
- ✅ Linear interpolation beamforming
- ✅ Allow NumPy/CuPy/JAX/PyTorch inputs through Array API
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ PyPI packaging and distribution
- ✅ Interpolation options: nearest, linear, and quadratic

### Numerically validated, but looking for feedback on API
- ✅ Coherent compounding

See the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/Forest-Neurotech/projects/14) for our up-to-date roadmap.
We welcome [feature requests](https://github.com/Forest-Neurotech/mach/issues)!
